# Contributing to The Compass website

This repo holds the website only — for submitting *articles or content* to the
magazine itself, see [submit.html](submit.html) or email
compass.math.2024@gmail.com. This file is about editing the site's code.

## Workflow

- `main` is the live branch — anything pushed here deploys automatically via
  the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.
- `main` is protected: force-pushes and branch deletion are blocked. Direct
  pushes are still allowed for now since there's a single maintainer: for
  small, safe edits (typo fixes, adding an issue to `index.html`), pushing
  straight to `main` is fine.
- For anything larger, or once more than one person is editing, open a pull
  request instead: create a branch, push it, and open a PR against `main` so
  changes get a review before going live.

## Making common changes

- **Add a new issue** — see the "Adding a new issue" section in
  [README.md](README.md).
- **Edit submission guidelines** — edit `submit.html` directly; it's a
  self-contained file independent of `index.html`.
- **Change site design or behaviour** — everything is in `index.html`'s
  `<style>` and `<script>` blocks; there's no build step, so changes take
  effect as soon as they're pushed and the Actions workflow finishes
  (usually under a minute).

## Before pushing

- Open `index.html` in a browser (or run `python3 -m http.server 8000` and
  visit `http://localhost:8000`) to sanity-check changes.
- If you edited the `<script>` block, it's worth pasting it into a JS linter
  or running `node -e "new Function(require('fs').readFileSync('index.html','utf8').match(/<script>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/)[1])"`
  from the repo root to catch syntax errors before they go live.
