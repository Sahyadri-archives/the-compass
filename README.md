# The Compass — website

Online magazine of the Community Mathematics Centre, Schools of the Krishnamurti Foundation India (KFI).

The core site is a single file, `index.html` — no build step, runs on GitHub Pages as is. A few supporting pages (submissions, 404) and files (SEO, housekeeping) sit alongside it; see the folder layout below.

## Folder layout

│   └── …
└── covers/                       ← optional cover images
    └── vol-3-3.jpg
```

PDF file names must match the `file` entries in the `ISSUES` list near the bottom of `index.html`.

## Repo hygiene

- `main` is protected against force-pushes and deletion.
- Site deploys are handled by `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` — GitHub Pages is set to "Deploy from GitHub Actions" in **Settings → Pages**, not "Deploy from a branch".
- Every push runs a `checks` job first: an internal-link checker and a Lighthouse CI report (accessibility/performance). Both are informational — neither blocks a deploy — so check the Actions run summary occasionally for anything they flag.
- Issue templates live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — bug reports and content-correction suggestions get a structured form; the config also points people submitting *articles* to `submit.html` instead.
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the day-to-day editing workflow.

## Publishing on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub (for example `the-compass`).
2. Add all the files in this repo — `index.html`, `submit.html`, `404.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `README.md` — plus the `pdfs` folder (see the note on large files below).
3. In the repository, open **Settings → Pages**. Under "Build and deployment", choose **GitHub Actions** as the source (the workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` handles the rest — no branch/folder to pick).
4. After a minute or two the site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/the-compass/`.

## Large PDF files: important

GitHub has file-size limits that matter for a magazine archive:

- **Uploading through the GitHub website is limited to 25 MB per file.** A 45 MB PDF must be added with **GitHub Desktop** or the `git` command line instead.
- GitHub warns about files over 50 MB and **refuses files over 100 MB**.
- Don't use Git LFS for the PDFs: GitHub Pages doesn't serve LFS files.
- A GitHub Pages site should stay under about 1 GB in total.

If issues grow past 100 MB, or the archive gets close to 1 GB, attach the PDFs to a **GitHub Release** instead (each file there can be up to 2 GB) and put the release download link in the `file` field. Downloads still work; the progress bar just changes to a "Starting download…" indicator, because the browser can't measure files hosted on a different address.

## Adding a new issue

Open `index.html`, find `const ISSUES = [` and add the new issue at the **top** of the list. The first entry automatically becomes the current issue (including the hero line), and the previous one moves into the archive.

```js
{ id:"3-4", volume:3, number:4, month:"October", year:2026, file:"pdfs/The-Compass-Vol-3-4.pdf", size:"", cover:"" },
```

- `size` — leave empty and the site reads the real file size once it's online, or type it yourself (`"45 MB"`).
- `cover` — leave empty for a generated cover, or give an image path such as `"covers/vol-3-4.jpg"` (an A4-shaped image around 600 × 850 px works well).

## Search

The Archive section has a search box that filters issues live by volume, month, or year — driven entirely by the `ISSUES` data, no extra setup needed.

## Write for us

`submit.html` is a standalone page with submission guidelines for teachers and students who want to contribute. It's linked from the main nav ("Write for us") and the footer. Edit the topics list, guidelines, and the contact email directly in that file — it's independent of `index.html` and needs no build step either.

## Testing on your own computer

Opening `index.html` by double-clicking works, but file sizes and the download progress bar only appear when the site is served from a web address. To preview properly, run this in the folder and open `http://localhost:8000`:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## What's inside

- 3D brass compass: three.js. The case turns as you scroll, and the needle swings and settles back to north.
- Antique world map: d3 and Natural Earth data, drawn with engraved coastlines and portolan rhumb lines.
- Fonts: Cormorant Garamond (headings) and Source Sans 3 (body text), from Google Fonts.
- Accessibility: works with keyboard and screen readers, and respects the "reduce motion" setting. If 3D isn't available, a flat compass is shown instead.
- Dark mode: a toggle in the nav (moon/sun icon) switches the site's reading chrome — nav, sections, footer, forms — between light and dark. It defaults to the visitor's OS preference and remembers their choice via `localStorage`. The hero (compass + map) stays the same in both themes by design, like a book's cover art.
